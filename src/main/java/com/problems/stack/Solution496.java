/**
 * You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s
 * elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's
 * elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
 * 
 * The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to
 * its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
 * 
 * Example 1: Input: 
 * nums1 = [4,1,2], 
 * nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. 
 * Output: [-1,3,-1]
 * 
 * Explanation: For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next
 * greater number for it in the second array, so output -1. For number 1 in the
 * first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3. For
 * number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the
 * second array, so output -1.
 * 
 * O(2n) for building map
 * O(n + m)
 * IDEA:
 *  take the current and go though the stack of elems seen so far to check whom this elem is the biggest for
 *
