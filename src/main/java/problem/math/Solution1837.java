/**
 * 
 * Given an integer n (in base 10) and a base k, return the sum of the digits of
 * n after converting n from base 10 to base k.
 * 
 * After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base 10 number, and
 * the sum should be returned in base 10.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 34, k = 6 Output: 9 
 * 
 * Explanation: 34 (base 10) expressed in base 6
 * is 54. 5 + 4 = 9.
