/**
 * Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total
 * number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k. 
 * Example 1: Input:nums =
 * [1,1,1], k = 2 Output: 2 sum array 
 * 
 * [1,2,3] 
 * 
 * The idea behind this approach is as follows: If
 * the cumulative sum(represented by sum[i] for sum ith index) upto two indices
 * is the same, the sum of the elements lying in between those indices is zero.
 * Extending the same thought further, if the cumulative sum upto two indices,
 * say i and j is at a difference: sum[i]âˆ’sum[j]=tgt, the sum of elements lying
 * between indices i and j is tgt 
 * 
 * We traverse over the array numsnums and keep
 * on finding the cumulative sum. Every time we encounter a new sum, we make a
 * new entry in the hashmap corresponding to that sum. If the same sum occurs
 * again, we increment the count corresponding to that sum in the hashmap.
